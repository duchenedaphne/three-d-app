# My first 3D app

This is my first real time animated 3D application, built using React Three Fiber and React Three Drei for WebGL rendering.

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive 3D Model: A GLB model created with Blender, imported and animated in the scene.

- Camera Controls: Implemented using CameraControls from React Three Drei for smooth user navigation.

- Click Interaction: Rotation effect on model when clicked.

- Optimized Performance: Efficient rendering and animations using React Three Fiber.

- Responsive Design: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a flexible and modern UI.

You can test it [here](https://duchenedaphne.github.io/three-d-app/).
